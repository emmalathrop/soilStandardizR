# soilStandardizR

Welcome to soilStandardizR! The goal of this package is to help
standardize soil core data, by depth or horizon. This allows for the
comparison of properties of core in depth increments that are the same,
throughout time, or from core to core.

For example, if you collected 10 cores that range in depth increments
sampled (i.e.Â a core with a sample from 0 to 5cm depth and another core
with 0 to 7 cm depth) and in terminal depths collected, this package can
help to standardize the depths, and the soil properties measured at the
non standard depths, to compare between cores.
