# soilStandardizR

Welcome to soilStandardizR! The goal of this package is to help standardize soil core data, by depth or horizon. This allows for the comparison of properties of core in depth increments that are the same, throughout time, or from core to core. 

For example, if you collected 10 cores that range in depth increments sampled (i.e. a core with a sample from 0 to 5cm depth and another core with 0 to 7 cm depth) and in terminal depths collected, this package can help to standardize the depths.
